# 🌱 Environmental Impact of Food Production Analysis

## 📖 Project Overview
Food production is one of the most significant contributors to environmental degradation, influencing climate change, water scarcity, land use, and biodiversity loss. This project analyses the environmental footprint of various food products and production stages, providing actionable insights for policymakers, producers, and consumers.  

By leveraging data on emissions, land use, and water usage, the project highlights sustainability trade-offs and identifies hotspots that can guide better decision-making.  

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Assess environmental impacts of food production across CO₂ emissions, land use, water use, and eutrophication.  
- Identify hotspots in food groups and production stages.  
- Develop actionable recommendations for more sustainable food systems.  
- Deliver a reproducible workflow (data cleaning, modelling, and visualisation).  
- Document methodology and outputs using GitHub for transparency.

## 📊 Dataset
**Source:** Environmental impacts of food production dataset (Food_Production.csv).  
The dataset includes:  
- Food product names and category.  
- Greenhouse gas emissions (kgCO₂eq).  
- Land use (m²).  
- Freshwater withdrawals (litres).  
- Scarcity-weighted water use.  
- Eutrophying emissions (gPO₄eq).  
- Lifecycle stage contributions (Farm, Land-use change, Processing, Transport, Packaging, Retail).

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- **Power BI**: Data cleaning, modelling, and interactive visualisation.  
- **Power Query**: Data preprocessing, handling nulls, creating dimensions.  
- **DAX**: Calculated measures, ranking, group averages.  
- **GitHub**: Documentation, scripts, reproducibility.  
- **Excel**: Preliminary data exploration.

## 📈 Methodology (CRISP-DM)
1. **Business Understanding**: Defined the problem and framed 7 analytical questions.  
2. **Data Understanding**: Explored dataset, identified nulls, grouped food items.  
3. **Data Preparation**: Created dimension tables (Food, Food Groups), modelled fact table, added IDs.  
4. **Modelling**: Built KPIs, applied DAX measures, visualised hotspots and trade-offs.  
5. **Evaluation**: Interpreted results with a sustainability lens.  
6. **Deployment**: Published Power BI dashboards, GitHub repo, and presentation.

## 📌 Key Insights
- Meat and stimulants (coffee, chocolate) drive highest CO₂ emissions and land use.  
- Pulses and vegetables offer lower-impact alternatives.  
- Farm and land-use change dominate lifecycle emissions.  
- Nuts & Seeds are water-intensive, highlighting scarcity risks.  

---

## 📦 Deliverables
- Power BI Report (Environmental Impact Dashboard).  
- Documentation (README, methodology, daily logs).  
- GitHub repository with scripts, visuals, and project files.  
- PowerPoint presentation summarising findings.
