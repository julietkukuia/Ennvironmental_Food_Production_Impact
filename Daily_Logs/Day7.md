🗓 Day 7 – Trade-offs & Hotspots

Date: 2025-09-07

✅ Tasks Completed

Initially tested scatter plot to show trade-offs (Land vs CO₂ vs Water).

Found scatterplots cluttered and less intuitive.

Pivoted to cleaner visuals:

KPI indicators (Impact Index, Highest Impact Food, Lowest Impact Food).

Pie chart for CO₂ Impact Classes.

Multi-metric comparative table (Land, Water, GHG).

Hotspot bar chart (Top Foods by Multi-Dimensional Impact).

📊 Key Findings

Beef, Lamb & Mutton, and Dark Chocolate emerged as clear hotspots.

Trade-offs across dimensions (e.g., water vs land) were more visible in comparative tables.

⚠️ Challenges & Fixes

Challenge	Fix
Scatter plot complexity	Replaced with KPIs, pie, and tables for clarity

🧠 Key Learnings

Sometimes simpler visuals communicate trade-offs better than complex ones.
